===========

  * Functions generated by `declare ffi` that return c-struct literals must reverse the order of members.
    (this can also be done in one of the c conversion functions)
  * Test the `declare ffi` extension - slogan_obj->c_struct conversion,
    test all types in function arguments, return values and struct members.
  * Implement a package manager.
