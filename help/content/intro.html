        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The best way to learn a new programming language is to use it. This is especially true for an interactive language like Slogan.
          The Slogan REPL is the interactive front-end of the language. The prompt <code>&gt;</code> that you see at the REPL means that
          Slogan is waiting for your input. As you enter expressions at the REPL, the Slogan interpreter will evaluate them and display
          their values. Then the prompt is displayed again for receiving more input. Hence the name Read-Eval-Print-Loop.</p>
        <p>The simplest expression that you can enter at the REPL is an integer. As you can see from the following session, Slogan
          expects each expression to be terminated by a <code>;</code>.</p>
        <pre>
          > 7;
          => 7
        </pre>
        <p>For a value like an integer, there is nothing much the interpreter has got to do. It just prints the value back. So let us
        give the interpreter some real work to do, like adding two numbers:</p>
        <pre>
          > 2 + 3;
          => 5
          </pre>
        <p>In this expression <code>+</code> is called the <i>operator</i>. <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> are <i>operands</i>.
          Slogan has four operators for doing arithmetic: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code>.
          Multiplication (<code>*</code>) and division (<code>/</code>) takes higher precedence over addition (<code>+</code>) and
          subtraction (<code>-</code>). Expressions can be grouped together in parenthesis to make sub-expressions: </p>
        <pre>
          > 3 + 4 * 5;
          => 23
          > (3 + 4) * 5;
          => 35
        </pre>
        <h3>Data types</h3>
        <p>Slogan offers all data types found in other languages. It also has types not found in most other languages.
          We have already seen the type <i>integer</i>. Another data type is <i>string</i> which is a series of characters
          enclosed in double-quotes. Like integers, strings evaluate to themselves:</p>
        <pre>
          > "hello, world";
          => "hello, world"
        </pre>
        <p>Two Slogan data types that are not commonly found in other languages are <i>symbols</i> and <i>lists</i>.
          Symbols are names or identifiers that usually refer to other values. So when you enter a symbol at the REPL,
          it will evaluate to the value <i>bound</i> to the symbol. To use a symbol as a literal or make it evaluate to itself
          you precede it with the exclamation mark:</p>
        <pre>
          > !hello;
          => !hello
        </pre>
        <p><i>Lists</i> are zero or more comma separated elements enclosed in brackets. The elements can be of any type including other lists.</p>
        <pre>
          > [1, 2, 3, "hello, world"];
          => [1, 2, 3, "hello, world"];
          > [];
          => []
          > [1, [2, 3], !hi];
          => [1, [2, 3], !hi]
        </pre>
        <p>
