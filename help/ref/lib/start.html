        <p>The purpose of this document is to describe the standard built-in functions and libraries that comes packaged with Slogan.
          The Slogan interpreter and compiler has access to a number of useful functions, most of which are used for manipulating
          primitive data like numbers, strings and lists. These functions are covered in the section <b>Standard Functions</b>.
          The Slogan distribution also has a number of libraries written mostly in Slogan itself which should be explicitly 
          <em>imported</em> by user programs. These libraries are the subject of <b>Standard Libraries</b>. Please note that
          a conforming implementation of Slogan need to provide only the functions described in <b>Standard Functions</b>.</p>
