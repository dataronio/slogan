        <h2>The Slogan Tutorial</h2>
        <p>Slogan is a simple language. Its syntax must be familiar to most programmers, 
          especially those who have worked with JavaScript or some language in the C family. Slogan's semantics is modeled after the 
          programming language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>.
          This means that you need to master only a small set of concepts to program in the small as well
          as in the large.</p>
        <p>The following tutorial will help you get started programming in Slogan. It makes no assumption about your programming
          background. All sample code can be directly entered at the REPL and evaluated. In the text of the tutorial, an 
          expression or a program statement to be typed at the REPL is preceded by a <code>></code> and the result of evaluation will 
          be prefixed by a <code>=></code>.</p>
