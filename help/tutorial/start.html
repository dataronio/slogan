        <h2>The Slogan Tutorial</h2>
        <p>Slogan allows you to program at a very high level using expressions and functions. 
          Slogan's semantics is modeled after the venerable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>.
          This means Slogan stands on solid ground and will be a pleasant and versatile tool - for both the experienced and the novice.</p>
        <p>This tutorial will get you started programming with Slogan, as quickly as possible. All sample code can be directly entered at the REPL 
          and evaluated. In the text of the tutorial, an expression or a program statement to be typed at the REPL is preceded by 
          a <code>&gt;</code> and the result of evaluation will be prefixed by <code>=&gt;</code>.</p>
