        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>Functions are at the core of Slogan. They are the primary means of abstraction provided by the language. Functions have first-class
          status - they can be assigned to variables, passed to other functions as arguments. You can also write functions that create
          new functions as their result. The <code>function</code> keyword is used to introduce a function literal:</p>
        <pre>
          function (&lt;param1&gt;, &lt;param2&gt; ...) {
              // function body
          }</pre>
        <p>The function object has a pointer to the environment in which it was created. So in addition to its parameters, its body
          can refer to variables in the defining environment. Just like the <code>let*</code> expressions, a function can shadow
          definitions in this environment with definitions of its own:</p>
        <pre>
          > var x = 10;
          > var y = 20;
          > function (z) { x + y + z } (30);
          => 60
          > function (x, z) { x + y + z } (100, 30);
          => 150
          > function (z) { let x = 1, y= 2 x + y + z } (30);
          => 33 </pre>
        <p>The first function adds two numbers in the global environment (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) with a parameter of its own 
          (<code>z</code>). The second function shadows the global <code>x</code> with one of its parameter of the same name. The third
          function has a <code>let</code> expression that shadows both the global variables.</p>
