        <h2>Distributed Computing</h2>
	<p>In the <a href="tasts.html">previous chapter</a> we saw how a Slogan program can execute mutiple independet tasks simultaneosly.
	  We also saw how these tasks can work together by passing messages to each other. This chapter shows how separate Slogan programs
	  communicate and coordinate their actions by message passing. The programs participating in the distributed computation may run on the
	  same computer or on separate computers connected by a network. Messaging happens over <em>sockets</em>. These are not the same sockets 
	  that you might have encountered in networking libraries of other languages. Slogan messaging sockets are objects that can efficiently transfer 
	  messages over a number of transports: in-process, inter-process and TCP. Slogan sockets are also highly scalable, taking advantage
	  of event-based IO facilities provided by the underlying operating system. If you are familiar with <a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a>
	  you know what this is all about. The messaging framework of Slogan is implemented on top of <a href="http://nanomsg.org">nanomsg</a>,
	  the next generation ZeroMQ.</p>
	<p>This chapter introduces the different patterns in which Slogan programs can form distributed systems. </p>
	<h3>Request-Reply</h3>
	<p>One of the simplest distributed computing pattern in <em>Request-Reply</em>. In the pattern a client application sends requests to
	  stateless workers and receieve responses. Here we re-implement the echo server from the streams chapter using this pattern:</p>
