        <h2>Streams</h2>
        <p>Streams are input and output devices that can read and write characters. Slogan supports various types of streams:
          files, strings, byte arrays, network etc. All types of streams can be created with a single constructor 
          called <code>stream</code>.</p>
        <p>The common functions used to read from an input stream are <code>read_char</code> and
          <code>read_expression</code>. <code>read_char</code> reads and returns a single character from the stream. 
          To check if a character is ready to be read from the stream you can use the <code>is_char_ready</code> predicate.
          <code>peek_char</code> returns the next character without actually removing it from the stream. 
          <code>read_expression</code> reads a whole Slogan expression from the stream. It means it can be used to read
          literals for strings, numbers, lists, functions and other Slogan data. The function <code>read_program</code>
          is used to read whole program statements from streams, including semicolon terminated variable declarations,
          assignments and record definitions.</p>
        <p>An attempt to read beyond the end of the stream will return a special object called the <code>end-of-stream</code>. 
          The predicate <code>is_eos</code> checks if an object represents the end-of-stream.</p>
        <p>Data is written to streams using the <code>print</code>, <code>println</code>, <code>write_char</code> and 
          <code>write_expression</code> functions. <code>print</code> can take an arbitrary number of Slogan data and output
          their human-readable representation. <code>println</code> is the same as <code>print</code> but it also emits a
          newline character after the data. This is achieved by calling the <code>newline</code> function. <code>write_char</code>
          writes an individual character to the stream and <code>write_expression</code> writes a whole scheme expression.</p>
        <p>All the input/output functions take optional keyword arguments that specifies the target stream. These arguments are
          named <code>input</code> and <code>output</code>. These arguments defaults to the values returned by
          the functions <code>current_input_stream</code> and <code>current_output_stream</code> respectively. These correspond to
          <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> in the C language.</p>
        <p>There are a few more stream input/output functions that we did not mention here. They will be introduced as we
          discuss specific stream types.</p>
