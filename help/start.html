        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Slogan is a general purpose, dynamically typed, expression-oriented programming language.
          Slogan makes it easy to write multi-threaded, distributed applications.
          The current implementation of Slogan comes with an interpreter and an optimizing compiler 
          that generates platform specific binaries.</p>
        <h2>Installing Slogan</h2>
        <p>You can fetch the latest source code of Slogan from <a href="https://github.com/vijaymathew/slogan">github</a>.
          Slogan should build without problems on all modern Unixes - including GNU/Linux and the various BSDs.
          Once you have cloned the git repository, issue these commands to compile Slogan:
          <pre>
            $ cd /path-to-slogan-directory
            $ ./configure-platform
            $ make
            $ ./src/slogan
          </pre>
          Once you execute the last command, you should see a prompt like this:
          <pre>
            slogan>
          </pre>
          This is the Slogan REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) where you can enter expressions.
          Slogan will print back the result of evaluating the expressions.
          Here is are a few expressions that you may want to try:
          <pre>
            slogan> "hello, world";
            hello, world
            slogan> 1 + 2;
            3
          </pre>
          Congratulations for executing your first programs in Slogan!
          To quit the REPL, type `exit();' and press enter.<br />

          To compile Slogan programs from any directory, you have to create the environment variable `SLOGAN_ROOT':

          <pre>
            $ export SLOGAN_ROOT=/path-to-slogan-directory
          </pre>
          
          <h2>Learn Slogan</h2>
        <p>Slogan is easy to learn. Its syntax must be familiar to most programmers, 
          especially those who have worked with JavaScript or some 
          language in the C family. Slogan's semantics is modeled after the 
          programming language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>.
          This means that you need to master only a small set of concepts to program in the small as well
          as in the large.</p>
        <p>The following tutorial will help you get started programming in Slogan. It assumes no previous programming
          background. I hope even experienced programmers, who are new to functional programming, will enjoy it. </p>
        <p>All sample code can be directly entered at the REPL and evaluated. In the text of the tutorial, an expression or
          a program statement to be typed at the REPL is preceded by a ">" and the result of evaluation will be prefixed 
          by a "=>".
