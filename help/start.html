        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Slogan is a general purpose, dynamically typed, expression-oriented programming language.
          Slogan makes it easy to write multi-threaded, distributed applications.
          The current implementation of Slogan comes with an interpreter and an optimizing compiler 
          that generates platform specific binaries.</p>
        <h2>Installing Slogan</h2>
        <p>You can fetch the latest source code of Slogan from <a href="https://github.com/vijaymathew/slogan">github</a>.
          Slogan should build without problems on all modern Unixes - including GNU/Linux and the various BSDs.
          Once you have cloned the git repository, issue these commands to compile Slogan:
          <pre>
            $ cd /path-to-slogan-directory
            $ ./configure-platform
            $ make
            $ ./src/slogan
          </pre>
          Once you execute the last command, you should see a prompt like this:
          <pre>
            slogan>
          </pre>
          This is the Slogan REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) where you can enter expressions.
          Slogan will print back the result of evaluating the expressions.
          Here is are a few expressions that you may want to try:
          <pre>
            slogan> "hello, world";
            hello, world
            slogan> 1 + 2;
            3
          </pre>
          Congratulations for executing your first programs in Slogan!
          To quit the REPL, type `exit();' and press enter.<br />

          To compile Slogan programs from any directory, you have to create the environment variable `SLOGAN_ROOT':

          <pre>
            $ export SLOGAN_ROOT=/path-to-slogan-directory
          </pre>
          
          <h2>Learn Slogan</h2>
        <p>Slogan is easy to learn. Its syntax must be familiar to most programmers, 
          especially those who have worked with JavaScript or some 
          language in the C family. Slogan's semantics is modeled after the 
          programming language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>.
          This means that you need to master only a small set of concepts to program in the small as well
          as in the large.</p>
        <p>The following tutorial will help you get started programming in Slogan. It assumes no previous programming
          background but I hope experienced programmers, who are new to functional programming, will also enjoy it. 
          All sample code can be directly entered at the REPL and evaluated. In the text of the tutorial, the result
          of evaluation will be prefixed by "=>" to differentiate it from program input.
