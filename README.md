Slogan is a general purpose programming language with facilities for concurrent and parallel computing.

### Building and running Slogan

    $ sudo ./install

If you want to hack on Slogan itself, you may want to follow a more traditional approach:
    
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ sudo make install


After the installation is complete, you can start the REPL by typing:
    
    $ slogan

(If you skipped system-wide installation, run `./src/slogan` instead.)


Visit http://schemer.in/slogan/ for tutorials and detailed documentation on the language.
