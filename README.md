Slogan is a general purpose, high-level, expression oriented language.
This implementation comes with an interpreter and a compiler that generates 
platform specific executable binaries.

To build Slogan follow these steps:

 
  1. ./configure
  2. make
  3. cd src; ./slogan

The last step will land you in the Slogan REPL.

Slogan is still in the very early stages of design and implementation.
